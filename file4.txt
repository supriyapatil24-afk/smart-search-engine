Graphs consist of nodes and edges that connect pairs of nodes.
They are used to model relationships between entities, such as social networks or city maps.
Trees are a special type of graph with hierarchical structure and no cycles.
Binary trees, binary search trees, and AVL trees are common examples.
Graph traversal algorithms include depth first search and breadth first search.
