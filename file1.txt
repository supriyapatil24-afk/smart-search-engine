Data structures are fundamental to computer science. 
They organize data so that it can be used efficiently. 
Common types include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. 
Each data structure has its own advantages depending on the problem being solved. 
For example, stacks are used in expression evaluation and function call management.
Queues are used in scheduling and breadth first search algorithms.
Trees and graphs are used to represent hierarchical and networked data.
