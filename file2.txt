Sorting algorithms are used to arrange data in a specific order, such as ascending or descending. 
Popular sorting techniques include bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort, and insertion sort.
Merge sort and quick sort use the divide and conquer strategy.
Searching algorithms like linear search and binary search are used to find elements efficiently.
The choice of algorithm depends on time complexity and the size of the input data.
